# PizzaSalesProject

Pizza Sales Analysis - Exploring pizza sales trends, order patterns, and pizza preferences using SQL. 

In this project, I dive deep into a dataset about a restaurant's pizza sales. From tracking the number of orders to dissecting the types of pizza preferred by customers, this project uncovers fascinating insights about pizza consumption trends. 

The original dataset has the following columns:

Headers	Description
pizza_id:	Pizza ID
order_id:	Order ID
pizza_name_id:	Pizza Name
quantity:	Number of Pizzas orderes
order_date:	Order Date
order_time:	Order Time
unit_price:	Price of the pizza
total_price:	Total Prize
pizza_size:	Pizza Size
pizza_category:	Pizza Category
pizza_ingredients:	Pizza Ingredients
pizza_name:	Pizza Name cleaned


This repository contains SQL scripts used to query and analyze the pizza sales dataset. The analysis is designed to extract valuable insights, answer questions about customer behavior, and inform strategic decisions for the restaurant. The SQL code is organized into clear sections, making it easy to understand and replicate the analysis.

In the second part of this project I use Tableau to create some visualizations about the dataset:https://public.tableau.com/views/pizzaproject_16947262408680/BestWorstSellers?:language=es-ES&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
