# PizzaSalesProject

Pizza Sales Analysis - Exploring pizza sales trends, order patterns, and pizza preferences using SQL. 

In this project, I dive deep into a dataset about a restaurant's pizza sales. From tracking the number of orders to dissecting the types of pizza preferred by customers, this project uncovers fascinating insights about pizza consumption trends. 

The original dataset has the following columns:

Pizza ID
Order ID
Pizza Name
Number of Pizzas orderes
Order Date
Order Time
Price of the pizza
Total Prize
Pizza Size
Pizza Category
Pizza Ingredients
Pizza Name cleaned


This repository contains SQL scripts used to query and analyze the pizza sales dataset. The analysis is designed to extract valuable insights, answer questions about customer behavior, and inform strategic decisions for the restaurant. The SQL code is organized into clear sections, making it easy to understand and replicate the analysis.

In the second part of this project I use Tableau to create some visualizations about the dataset:https://public.tableau.com/views/pizzaproject_16947262408680/BestWorstSellers?:language=es-ES&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
