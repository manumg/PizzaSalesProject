# PizzaSalesProject

Pizza Sales Analysis - Exploring pizza sales trends, order patterns, and pizza preferences using SQL. 

This repository contains SQL scripts used to query and analyze the pizza sales dataset. The analysis is designed to extract valuable insights, answer questions about customer behavior, and inform strategic decisions for the restaurant. The SQL code is organized into clear sections, making it easy to understand and replicate the analysis.

In the second part of this project I use Tableau to create some visualizations about the dataset:https://public.tableau.com/views/pizzaproject_16947262408680/BestWorstSellers?:language=es-ES&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
